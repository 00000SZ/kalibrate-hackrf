Kalibrate, or kal, can scan for GSM base stations in a given frequency band and
can use those GSM base stations to calculate the local oscillator frequency
offset.

2014-8-23 Update:

Thanks to chris.kuethe@gmail.com who did a bunch of tinkering with this port of kalibrate.

https://github.com/ckuethe/kalibrate-hackrf/

This now runs as fast as kalibrate-rtl


2015-3-3 Update:

Add ability to specify channel when scanning to check power output for a single channel.
